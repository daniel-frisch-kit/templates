 abstract = {Two convergence aspects of the EM algorithm are studied: (i) does the EM algorithm find a local maximum or a stationary value of the (incomplete-data) likelihood function? (ii) does the sequence of parameter estimates generated by EM converge? Several convergence results are obtained under conditions that are applicable to many practical situations. Two useful special cases are: (a) if the unobserved complete-data specification can be described by a curved exponential family with compact parameter space, all the limit points of any EM sequence are stationary points of the likelihood function; (b) if the likelihood function is unimodal and a certain differentiability condition is satisfied, then any EM sequence converges to the unique maximum likelihood estimate. A list of key properties of the algorithm is included.},

 abstract = {The problem of estimating the parameters which determine a mixture density has been the subject of a large, diverse body of literature spanning nearly ninety years. During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities, focussing in particular on mixtures of densities from exponential families.},

abstract = "This study promotes the use of statistical methods in specific classification tasks since statistical methods have certain advantages which advocate their use in pattern recognition. One central problem in statistical methods is estimation of class conditional probability density functions based on examples in a training set. In this study maximum likelihood estimation methods for Gaussian mixture models are reviewed and discussed from a practical point of view. In addition, good practices for utilizing probability densities in feature classification and selection are discussed for Bayesian and, more importantly, for non-Bayesian tasks. As a result, the use of confidence information in the classification is proposed and a method for confidence estimation is presented. The propositions are tested experimentally."

We introduce the concept of ontogenetic graph as a parsimonious and mechanistically relevant representation of a pattern. The ontogenetic graph is extracted from the local geometry of the pattern and does not impose large-scale regularity on it as for the divergence angle and other classical descriptors. We exemplify our approach by analyzing the phyllotaxis of two asteraceae inflorescences in the light of a hard disk model. The simulated patterns offer a very good match to the observed patterns for over 150 iterations of the model.},

abstract = {The cubature Kalman filter (CKF), which is based on the third degree spherical–radial cubature rule, is numerically more stable than the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) but less accurate than the Gauss–Hermite quadrature filter (GHQF). To improve the performance of the CKF, a new class of CKFs with arbitrary degrees of accuracy in computing the spherical and radial integrals is proposed. The third-degree CKF is a special case of the class. The high-degree CKFs of the class can achieve the accuracy and stability performances close to those of the GHQF but at lower computational cost. A numerical integration problem and a target tracking problem are utilized to demonstrate the necessity of using the high-degree cubature rules to improve the performance. The target tracking simulation shows that the fifth-degree CKF can achieve higher accuracy than the extended Kalman filter, the UKF, the third-degree CKF, and the particle filter, and is computationally much more efficient than the GHQF.}

We address the more general case of non-triangular elements, and provide a complete analysis of the case where the plane is discretized using a mesh of regular polygons, e.g. equilateral triangles, squares and hexagons, whose interiors are mapped using barycentric coordinate functions. We demonstrate experimentally that faster convergence to continuous conformal maps may be obtained this way. We provide a formulation of the problem and its solution using complex number algebra, significantly simplifying the notation. We examine a number of common barycentric coordinate functions and demonstrate that superior approximation to harmonic coordinates of a polygon are achieved by the Moving Least Squares coordinates. We also provide a simple iterative algorithm to invert barycentric maps of regular polygon meshes, allowing to apply them in practical applications, e.g. for texture mapping.},

Authors: Daniel Frisch, Uwe D. Hanebeck 

Abstract: We propose a simple and efficient method to obtain unweighted deterministic samples of the multivariate Gaussian density. It allows to place a large number of homogeneously placed samples even in high-dimensional spaces. There is a demand for large high-quality sample sets in many nonlinear filters. The Smart Sampling Kalman Filter (S2KF), for example, uses many samples and is an extension of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) that is limited due to its small sample set. Generalized Fibonacci grids have the property that if stretched or compressed along certain directions, the grid points keep approximately equal distances to all their neighbors. This can be exploited to easily obtain deterministic samples of arbitrary Gaussians. As the computational effort to generate these anisotropically scalable point sets is low, generalized Fibonacci grid sampling appears to be a great new source of large sample sets in high-quality state estimation.},

Even though every admissible lattice has this favorable asymptotic behavior, there are significant differences concerning the precise numerical behavior of the worst-case error. To this end, we propose new generating polynomials that promise a significant reduction in the integration error compared to the classical polynomials. Moreover, we develop a new algorithm to enumerate the Frolov points from non-orthogonal lattices for numerical cubature in the d-dimensional unit cube \$\$[0,1]{\textasciicircum}d\$\$. Finally, we study Sobolev spaces with anisotropic mixed smoothness and compact support in \$\$[0,1]{\textasciicircum}d\$\$and derive explicit formulas for their reproducing kernels. This allows for the simulation of exact worst-case errors which numerically validate our theoretical results.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present an aircraft localization solution developed in the context of the Aircraft Localization Competition and applied to the OpenSky Network real-world ADS-B data. The developed solution is based on a combination of machine learning and multilateration using data provided by time synchronized ground receivers. A gradient boosting regression technique is used to obtain an estimate of the geometric altitude of the aircraft, as well as a first guess of the 2D aircraft position. Then, a triplet-wise and an all-in-view multilateration technique are implemented to obtain an accurate estimate of the aircraft latitude and longitude. A sensitivity analysis of the accuracy as a function of the number of receivers is conducted and used to optimize the proposed solution. The obtained predictions have an accuracy below 25 m for the 2D root mean squared error and below 35 m for the geometric altitude.},

	abstract = {We introduce certain n X n matrices with integral elements that constitute a free semigroup with identity and generate the n-dimensional unimodular group. In terms of these matrices we define a certain sequence of n-dimensional vectors, which we show is the natural generalization to n dimensions of the Fibonacci sequence. Connections between the generalized Fibonacci sequences and certain Jacobi polynomials are found. The various basic identities concerning the Fibonacci numbers are shown to have natural extensions to n dimensions, and in some cases the proofs are rendered quite brief by the use of known theorems on matrices.},

	abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to find a formula to calculate any Fibonacci vector directly, not recursively, generalizing Binet’s formula for the original Fibonacci sequence. We begin with the recursive definition of Fibonacci vector sequences. Next, we discuss the roots of the Fibonacci characteristic polynomial and construct the root vector and root matrix. Then, we consider linear combinations of the powers of the root vector. Eventually, we find the particular combination that represents Fibonacci vectors. We show that in the case of two-dimensional vectors, this representation of the components of the vectors is identical to Binet’s formula for calculating Fibonacci numbers. We also illustrate the use of the Fibonacci vector calculation formula in the case of three-dimensional vectors.},
