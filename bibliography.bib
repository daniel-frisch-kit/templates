(ii) does the sequence of parameter estimates generated by EM converge? Several convergence results are obtained under conditions that are applicable to many practical situations. Two useful special cases are: (a) if the unobserved complete-data specification can be described by a curved exponential family with compact parameter space, all the limit points of any EM sequence are stationary points of the likelihood function; (b) if the likelihood function is unimodal and a certain differentiability condition is satisfied, then any EM sequence converges to the unique maximum likelihood estimate. A list of key properties of the algorithm is included.},

  abstract  = {The problem of estimating the parameters which determine a mixture density has been the subject of a large, diverse body of literature spanning nearly ninety years. During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities, focussing in particular on mixtures of densities from exponential families.},

One central problem in statistical methods is estimation of class conditional probability density functions based on examples in a training set. In this study maximum likelihood estimation methods for Gaussian mixture models are reviewed and discussed from a practical point of view. In addition, good practices for utilizing probability densities in feature classification and selection are discussed for Bayesian and, more importantly, for non-Bayesian tasks. As a result, the use of confidence information in the classification is proposed and a method for confidence estimation is presented. The propositions are tested experimentally.},

We introduce the concept of ontogenetic graph as a parsimonious and mechanistically relevant representation of a pattern. The ontogenetic graph is extracted from the local geometry of the pattern and does not impose large-scale regularity on it as for the divergence angle and other classical descriptors. We exemplify our approach by analyzing the phyllotaxis of two asteraceae inflorescences in the light of a hard disk model. The simulated patterns offer a very good match to the observed patterns for over 150 iterations of the model.},

  abstract  = {The cubature Kalman filter (CKF), which is based on the third degree spherical‚Äìradial cubature rule, is numerically more stable than the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) but less accurate than the Gauss--Hermite quadrature filter (GHQF). To improve the performance of the CKF, a new class of CKFs with arbitrary degrees of accuracy in computing the spherical and radial integrals is proposed. The third-degree CKF is a special case of the class. The high-degree CKFs of the class can achieve the accuracy and stability performances close to those of the GHQF but at lower computational cost. A numerical integration problem and a target tracking problem are utilized to demonstrate the necessity of using the high-degree cubature rules to improve the performance. The target tracking simulation shows that the fifth-degree CKF can achieve higher accuracy than the extended Kalman filter, the UKF, the third-degree CKF, and the particle filter, and is computationally much more efficient than the GHQF.},

  abstract = {Continuous conformal maps are typically approximated numerically using a triangle mesh which discretizes the plane. Computing a conformal map subject to user-provided constraints then reduces to a sparse linear system, minimizing a quadratic ‚Äòconformal energy‚Äô. We address the more general case of non-triangular elements, and provide a complete analysis of the case where the plane is discretized using a mesh of regular polygons, e.g. equilateral triangles, squares and hexagons, whose interiors are mapped using barycentric coordinate functions. We demonstrate experimentally that faster convergence to continuous conformal maps may be obtained this way. We provide a formulation of the problem and its solution using complex number algebra, significantly simplifying the notation. We examine a number of common barycentric coordinate functions and demonstrate that superior approximation to harmonic coordinates of a polygon are achieved by the Moving Least Squares coordinates. We also provide a simple iterative algorithm to invert barycentric maps of regular polygon meshes, allowing to apply them in practical applications, e.g. for texture mapping.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we deal with several aspects of the universal Frolov cubature method, which is known to achieve optimal asymptotic convergence rates in a broad range of function spaces. Even though every admissible lattice has this favorable asymptotic behavior, there are significant differences concerning the precise numerical behavior of the worst-case error. To this end, we propose new generating polynomials that promise a significant reduction in the integration error compared to the classical polynomials. Moreover, we develop a new algorithm to enumerate the Frolov points from non-orthogonal lattices for numerical cubature in the d-dimensional unit cube \$\$[0,1]{\textasciicircum}d\$\$. Finally, we study Sobolev spaces with anisotropic mixed smoothness and compact support in \$\$[0,1]{\textasciicircum}d\$\$and derive explicit formulas for their reproducing kernels. This allows for the simulation of exact worst-case errors which numerically validate our theoretical results.},

The developed solution is based on a combination of machine learning and multilateration using data provided by time synchronized ground receivers. A gradient boosting regression technique is used to obtain an estimate of the geometric altitude of the aircraft, as well as a first guess of the 2D aircraft position. Then, a triplet-wise and an all-in-view multilateration technique are implemented to obtain an accurate estimate of the aircraft latitude and longitude. A sensitivity analysis of the accuracy as a function of the number of receivers is conducted and used to optimize the proposed solution. The obtained predictions have an accuracy below 25 m for the 2D root mean squared error and below 35 m for the geometric altitude.},

Connections between the generalized Fibonacci sequences and certain Jacobi polynomials are found. The various basic identities concerning the Fibonacci numbers are shown to have natural extensions to n dimensions, and in some cases the proofs are rendered quite brief by the use of known theorems on matrices.},

We begin with the recursive definition of Fibonacci vector sequences. Next, we discuss the roots of the Fibonacci characteristic polynomial and construct the root vector and root matrix. Then, we consider linear combinations of the powers of the root vector. Eventually, we find the particular combination that represents Fibonacci vectors. We show that in the case of two-dimensional vectors, this representation of the components of the vectors is identical to Binet‚Äôs formula for calculating Fibonacci numbers. We also illustrate the use of the Fibonacci vector calculation formula in the case of three-dimensional vectors.},

For the one-dimensional case, we derive analytically the optimal size of the vector of control variates under specific assumptions on the covariance matrix. For the multidimensional case, our numerical results show that good variance reduction is achieved when the number of control variates is relatively small (approximately of the same order as the number of unknown parameters). Finally, we give some recommendations for future research.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Stratified sampling is a probability sampling method that is implemented in sample surveys. The target population's elements are divided into distinct groups or strata where within each stratum the elements are similar to each other with respect to select characteristics of importance to the survey. Stratification is also used to increase the efficiency of a sample design with respect to survey costs and estimator precision. In this article, the foundations of stratified sampling are discussed in the framework of simple random sampling. Topics include the forming of the strata and optimal sample allocation among the strata. Practical implementation issues for stratified sampling are discussed and include systematic sampling, implicit stratification, and the construction of strata using modern software. The importance of using stratified sampling in practice is demonstrated by its usage in five major large-scale health surveys conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom. For these surveys, details of the stratification and sampling methods are provided. Topics include multistage cluster sampling within strata and the use of systematic and probability proportional to size sampling.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo is one of the most versatile and widely used numerical methods. Its convergence rate, O(N‚àí1/2), is independent of dimension, which shows Monte Carlo to be very robust but also slow. This article presents an introduction to Monte Carlo methods for integration problems, including convergence theory, sampling methods and variance reduction techniques. Accelerated convergence for Monte Carlo quadrature is attained using quasi-random (also called low-discrepancy) sequences, which are a deterministic alternative to random or pseudo-random sequences. The points in a quasi-random sequence are correlated to provide greater uniformity. The resulting quadrature method, called quasi-Monte Carlo, has a convergence rate of approximately O((logN)kN‚àí1). For quasi-Monte Carlo, both theoretical error estimates and practical limitations are presented. Although the emphasis in this article is on integration, Monte Carlo simulation of rarefied gas dynamics is also discussed. In the limit of small mean free path (that is, the fluid dynamic limit), Monte Carlo loses its effectiveness because the collisional distance is much less than the fluid dynamic length scale. Computational examples are presented throughout the text to illustrate the theory. A number of open problems are described.},

  abstract = {We deal with lattices that are generated by the Vandermonde matrices associated to the roots of Chebyshev polynomials. If the dimension d of the lattice is a power of two, i.e. $$d=2^m, m \in \mathbb {N}$$, the resulting lattice is an admissible lattice in the sense of Skriganov. We prove that these lattices are orthogonal and possess a lattice representation matrix with orthogonal columns and entries not larger than 2 (in modulus). In particular, we clarify the existence of orthogonal admissible lattices in higher dimensions. The orthogonality property allows for an efficient enumeration of these lattices in axis parallel boxes. Hence they serve for a practical implementation of the Frolov cubature formulas, which recently drew attention due to their optimal convergence rates in a broad range of Besov-Lizorkin-Triebel spaces. As an application, we efficiently enumerate the Frolov cubature nodes in the d-cube $$[-1/2,1/2]^d$$up to dimension $$d=16$$.},

Here, we present successive orthogonal images, an effective means for uniform deterministic sampling of orthogonal groups. The method is valid in any dimension, and analytical bounds are provided on the sampling uniformity. Numerical comparisons with other sampling methods are given for the special case of \$SO(3)\$. We make use of non-Riemannian distance metrics that are group-invariant and locally compatible with the Haar measure. In addition, our results provide a semi-unique decomposition of any orthogonal matrix into the product of planar rotations.},

This chapter discusses computational investigations of low-discrepancy point sets. The quasi-Monte Carlo method of evaluation of a multiple integral consists of averaging function values over a well-distributed set of points in the region of integration. This method differs from classical methods, in which a part of some representation of the function is integrated exactly, and from the ordinary Monte Carlo method, where a random sample of function values is averaged. Error bounds for quasi-Monte Carlo integration can be based on various measures of the inequality in the distribution of the set of points over which the function is averaged. Any integration formula can be treated as quasi-Monte Carlo by using the bounds. The chapter presents the results of some computational studies of the L2 discrepancy of several types of sets of points, which are suitable for quasi-Monte Carlo integration of functions in the unit k-cube.},

  abstract = {We study an optimal control problem under uncertainty, where the target function is the solution of an elliptic partial differential equation with random coefficients, steered by a control function. The robust formulation of the optimization problem is stated as a high-dimensional integration problem over the stochastic variables. It is well known that carrying out a high-dimensional numerical integration of this kind using a Monte Carlo method has a notoriously slow convergence rate; meanwhile, a faster rate of convergence can potentially be obtained by using sparse grid quadratures, but these lead to discretized systems that are nonconvex due to the involvement of negative quadrature weights. In this paper, we analyze instead the application of a quasi-Monte Carlo method, which retains the desirable convexity structure of the system and has a faster convergence rate compared to ordinary Monte Carlo methods. In particular, we show that under moderate assumptions on the decay of the input random field, the error rate obtained by using a specially designed, randomly shifted rank-1 lattice quadrature rule is essentially inversely proportional to the number of quadrature nodes. The overall discretization error of the problem, consisting of the dimension truncation error, finite element discretization error, and quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature error, is derived in detail. We assess the theoretical findings in numerical experiments.},

Since the normal distribution occurs frequently in economic and financial modeling, one often needs a method to transform low-discrepancy sequences from the uniform distribution to the normal distribution. Two well known methods used with pseudorandom numbers are the Box‚ÄìMuller and the inverse transformation methods. Some researchers and financial engineers have claimed that it is incorrect to use the Box‚ÄìMuller method with low-discrepancy sequences, and instead, the inverse transformation method should be used. In this paper we prove that the Box‚ÄìMuller method can be used with low-discrepancy sequences, and discuss when its use could actually be advantageous. We also present numerical results that compare Box‚ÄìMuller and inverse transformation methods.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic sampling-based algorithms, such as the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) and the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithms, represent one of the most successful approaches to robotic motion planning, due to their strong theoretical properties (in terms of probabilistic completeness or even asymptotic optimality) and remarkable practical performance. Such algorithms are probabilistic in that they compute a path by connecting independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random points in the configuration space. Their randomization aspect, however, makes several tasks challenging, including certification for safety-critical applications and use of offline computation to improve real-time execution. Hence, an important open question is whether similar (or better) theoretical guarantees and practical performance could be obtained by considering deterministic, as opposed to random, sampling sequences. The objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous answer to this question. Specifically, we first show that PRM, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and deterministic low-dispersion sampling sequences, is deterministically asymptotically optimal, in other words, it returns a path whose cost converges deterministically to the optimal one as the number of points goes to infinity. Second, we characterize the convergence rate, and we find that the factor of sub-optimality can be very explicitly upper-bounded in terms of the‚Ñì2 -dispersion of the sampling sequence and the connection radius of PRM. Third, we show that an asymptotically optimal version of PRM exists with computational and space complexity arbitrarily close to O(n) (the theoretical lower bound), where n is the number of points in the sequence. This is in contrast to the O(nlogn) complexity results for existing asymptotically optimal probabilistic planners. Fourth, we discuss extending our theoretical results and insights to other batch-processing algorithms such as FMT*, to non-uniform sampling strategies, to k-nearest-neighbor implementations, and to differentially constrained problems. Importantly, our main theoretical tool is the ‚Ñì2-dispersion, an interesting consequence of which is that all our theoretical results also hold for low-‚Ñì2-dispersion random sampling (which i.i.d. sampling does not satisfy). In other words, achieving deterministic guarantees is really a matter of i.i.d. sampling versus non-i.i.d. low-dispersion sampling (with deterministic sampling as a prominent case), as opposed to random versus deterministic. Finally, through numerical experiments, we show that planning with deterministic (or random) low-dispersion sampling generally provides superior performance in terms of path cost and success rate.},

The performance of MCVI crucially depends on the variance of its stochastic gradients. We propose variance reduction by means of Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling. QMC replaces N i.i.d. samples from a uniform probability distribution by a deterministic sequence of samples of length N. This sequence covers the underlying random variable space more evenly than i.i.d. draws, reducing the variance of the gradient estimator. With our novel approach, both the score function and the reparameterization gradient estimators lead to much faster convergence. We also propose a new algorithm for Monte Carlo objectives, where we operate with a constant learning rate and increase the number of QMC samples per iteration. We prove that this way, our algorithm can converge asymptotically at a faster rate than SGD . We furthermore provide theoretical guarantees on qmc for Monte Carlo objectives that go beyond MCVI , and support our findings by several experiments on large-scale data sets from various domains.},

  abstract = {Highly structured generalised response models, such as generalised linear mixed models and generalised linear models for time series regression, have become an indispensable vehicle for data analysis and inference in many areas of application. However, their use in practice is hindered by high-dimensional intractable integrals. Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) is a dynamic research area in the general problem of high-dimensional numerical integration, although its potential for statistical applications is yet to be fully explored. We survey recent research in QMC, particularly lattice rules, and report on its application to highly structured generalised response models. New challenges for QMC are identified and new methodologies are developed. QMC methods are seen to provide significant improvements compared with ordinary Monte Carlo methods.},

More precisely, the goal is to find another function {\O} whose integral is equal to the integral of f but whose variance is smaller than that of f. Methods that achieve this are called variance reduction techniques, and we will be describing several of them in this chapter. This topic has been widely studied and is surveyed, for example, in [45, 165, 243, 247, 321, 391], which also give several other references.},

Besides sampling methods such as the conditional distribution method (based on a one-to-one transformation), it is also shown that typically faster sampling methods (based on stochastic representations) can be used to improve upon classical Monte Carlo methods when pseudo-random number generators are replaced by quasi-random number generators. This opens the door to quasi-random numbers for models well beyond independent margins or the multivariate normal distribution. Detailed examples (in the context of finance and insurance), illustrations and simulations are given and software has been developed and provided in the R¬†packages copula and qrng.},

One of the central issues is the classification of integral quadratic forms or lattices. The last section describes the problem of designing good quantizers or analog-to-digital converters.

  abstract = {We employ a quasirandom methodology, recently developed by Martin Roberts, to estimate the separability probabilities, with respect to the Bures (minimal monotone/statistical distinguishability) measure, of generic two-qubit and two-rebit states. This procedure, based on generalized properties of the golden ratio, yielded, in the course of almost seventeen billion iterations (recorded at intervals of five million), two-qubit estimates repeatedly close to nine decimal places to $$\frac{25}{341} =\frac{5^2}{11 \cdot 31} \approx 0.073313783$$. However, despite the use of over twenty-three billion iterations, we do not presently perceive an exact value (rational or otherwise) for an estimate of 0.15709623 for the Bures two-rebit separability probability. The Bures qubit-qutrit case--for which Khvedelidze and Rogojin gave an estimate of 0.0014--is analyzed too. The value of $$\frac{1}{715}=\frac{1}{5 \cdot 11 \cdot 13} \approx 0.00139860$$is a well-fitting value to an estimate of 0.00139884. Interesting values $$\big (\frac{16}{12375} =\frac{4^2}{3^2 \cdot 5^3 \cdot 11}$$and $$\frac{625}{109531136}=\frac{5^4}{2^{12} \cdot 11^2 \cdot 13 \cdot 17}\big )$$are conjectured for the Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) and Bures qubit-qudit ($$2 \times 4$$) positive-partial-transpose (PPT)-probabilities. We re-examine, strongly supporting, conjectures that the HS qubit-qutrit and rebit-retrit separability probabilities are $$\frac{27}{1000}=\frac{3^3}{2^3 \cdot 5^3}$$and $$\frac{860}{6561}= \frac{2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 43}{3^8}$$, respectively. Prior studies have demonstrated that the HS two-rebit separability probability is $$\frac{29}{64}$$and strongly pointed to the HS two-qubit counterpart being $$\frac{8}{33}$$and a certain operator monotone one (other than the Bures) being $$1 -\frac{256}{27 \pi ^2}$$.},

  abstract  = {An apparatus is described which facilitates the presentation of pairs of variable colors without variation of luminance. With this instrument, various criteria of visual sensitivity to color difference have been investigated. The standard deviation of color matching was finally adopted as the most reproducible criterion. The test field was two degrees in diameter, divided by a vertical biprism edge, and was viewed centrally with a surrounding field of forty-two degrees diameter uniformly illuminated so as to have a chromaticity similar to that of the I.C.I. Standard Illuminant C (average daylight). The luminance of the test field was maintained constant at 15 millilamberts, and the surrounding field was 7.5 millilamberts. These fields were viewed monocularly through an artificial pupil, 2.6 mm in diameter. Over twenty-five thousand trials at color matching have been recorded for a single observer, and the readings are analyzed in detail and compared with previously available data. The standard deviations of the trials are represented in terms of distance in the standard 1931 I.C.I. chromaticity diagram. These increments of distance are represented as functions of position alongstraight lines in the chromaticity diagram, and also as functions of direction of departure from points representing certain standard chromaticities. Such representations are simpler than the traditional representations of wave-length thresholds and purity thresholds as functions of wave-length, and the accuracy of the representations is improved by this simplicity. Chromaticity discrimination for non-spectral colors is represented simultaneously and on the same basis as for spectral colors. Small, equally noticeable chromaticity differences are represented for all chromaticities and for all kinds of variations by the lengths of the radii of a family of ellipses drawn on the standard chromaticity diagram. These ellipses cannot be transformed into equal-sized circles by any projective transformation of the standard chromaticity diagram. The consistency of these data with the results of other investigators is exhibited in terms of the noticeabilities of wave-length differences in the spectrum and of the noticeabilities of purity differences from a neutral stimulus, as functions of dominant wave-length.},

The presence of nontilted a-domains manifests clearly that the misfit strain is significantly reduced in PZT nanoislands, compared to the thin film. Some of the a-domains turned out to be switchable under an external electric field due to the strain relaxation in the PZT nanocapacitors.
