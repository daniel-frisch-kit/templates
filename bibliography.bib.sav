(ii) does the sequence of parameter estimates generated by EM converge? Several convergence results are obtained under conditions that are applicable to many practical situations. Two useful special cases are: (a) if the unobserved complete-data specification can be described by a curved exponential family with compact parameter space, all the limit points of any EM sequence are stationary points of the likelihood function; (b) if the likelihood function is unimodal and a certain differentiability condition is satisfied, then any EM sequence converges to the unique maximum likelihood estimate. A list of key properties of the algorithm is included.},

During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities, focussing in particular on mixtures of densities from exponential families.},

One central problem in statistical methods is estimation of class conditional probability density functions based on examples in a training set. In this study maximum likelihood estimation methods for Gaussian mixture models are reviewed and discussed from a practical point of view. In addition, good practices for utilizing probability densities in feature classification and selection are discussed for Bayesian and, more importantly, for non-Bayesian tasks. As a result, the use of confidence information in the classification is proposed and a method for confidence estimation is presented. The propositions are tested experimentally.},

We introduce the concept of ontogenetic graph as a parsimonious and mechanistically relevant representation of a pattern. The ontogenetic graph is extracted from the local geometry of the pattern and does not impose large-scale regularity on it as for the divergence angle and other classical descriptors. We exemplify our approach by analyzing the phyllotaxis of two asteraceae inflorescences in the light of a hard disk model. The simulated patterns offer a very good match to the observed patterns for over 150 iterations of the model.},

  abstract  = {The cubature Kalman filter (CKF), which is based on the third degree spherical‚Äìradial cubature rule, is numerically more stable than the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) but less accurate than the Gauss‚ÄìHermite quadrature filter (GHQF). To improve the performance of the CKF, a new class of CKFs with arbitrary degrees of accuracy in computing the spherical and radial integrals is proposed. The third-degree CKF is a special case of the class. The high-degree CKFs of the class can achieve the accuracy and stability performances close to those of the GHQF but at lower computational cost. A numerical integration problem and a target tracking problem are utilized to demonstrate the necessity of using the high-degree cubature rules to improve the performance. The target tracking simulation shows that the fifth-degree CKF can achieve higher accuracy than the extended Kalman filter, the UKF, the third-degree CKF, and the particle filter, and is computationally much more efficient than the GHQF.},

  abstract = {Continuous conformal maps are typically approximated numerically using a triangle mesh which discretizes the plane. Computing a conformal map subject to user-provided constraints then reduces to a sparse linear system, minimizing a quadratic ‚Äòconformal energy‚Äô. We address the more general case of non-triangular elements, and provide a complete analysis of the case where the plane is discretized using a mesh of regular polygons, e.g. equilateral triangles, squares and hexagons, whose interiors are mapped using barycentric coordinate functions. We demonstrate experimentally that faster convergence to continuous conformal maps may be obtained this way. We provide a formulation of the problem and its solution using complex number algebra, significantly simplifying the notation. We examine a number of common barycentric coordinate functions and demonstrate that superior approximation to harmonic coordinates of a polygon are achieved by the Moving Least Squares coordinates. We also provide a simple iterative algorithm to invert barycentric maps of regular polygon meshes, allowing to apply them in practical applications, e.g. for texture mapping.},

Authors: Daniel Frisch, Uwe D. Hanebeck 

Abstract: We propose a simple and efficient method to obtain unweighted deterministic samples of the multivariate Gaussian density. It allows to place a large number of homogeneously placed samples even in high-dimensional spaces. There is a demand for large high-quality sample sets in many nonlinear filters. The Smart Sampling Kalman Filter (S2KF), for example, uses many samples and is an extension of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) that is limited due to its small sample set. Generalized Fibonacci grids have the property that if stretched or compressed along certain directions, the grid points keep approximately equal distances to all their neighbors. This can be exploited to easily obtain deterministic samples of arbitrary Gaussians. As the computational effort to generate these anisotropically scalable point sets is low, generalized Fibonacci grid sampling appears to be a great new source of large sample sets in high-quality state estimation.},

Even though every admissible lattice has this favorable asymptotic behavior, there are significant differences concerning the precise numerical behavior of the worst-case error. To this end, we propose new generating polynomials that promise a significant reduction in the integration error compared to the classical polynomials. Moreover, we develop a new algorithm to enumerate the Frolov points from non-orthogonal lattices for numerical cubature in the d-dimensional unit cube \$\$[0,1]{\textasciicircum}d\$\$. Finally, we study Sobolev spaces with anisotropic mixed smoothness and compact support in \$\$[0,1]{\textasciicircum}d\$\$and derive explicit formulas for their reproducing kernels. This allows for the simulation of exact worst-case errors which numerically validate our theoretical results.},

The developed solution is based on a combination of machine learning and multilateration using data provided by time synchronized ground receivers. A gradient boosting regression technique is used to obtain an estimate of the geometric altitude of the aircraft, as well as a first guess of the 2D aircraft position. Then, a triplet-wise and an all-in-view multilateration technique are implemented to obtain an accurate estimate of the aircraft latitude and longitude. A sensitivity analysis of the accuracy as a function of the number of receivers is conducted and used to optimize the proposed solution. The obtained predictions have an accuracy below 25 m for the 2D root mean squared error and below 35 m for the geometric altitude.},

Connections between the generalized Fibonacci sequences and certain Jacobi polynomials are found. The various basic identities concerning the Fibonacci numbers are shown to have natural extensions to n dimensions, and in some cases the proofs are rendered quite brief by the use of known theorems on matrices.},

We begin with the recursive definition of Fibonacci vector sequences. Next, we discuss the roots of the Fibonacci characteristic polynomial and construct the root vector and root matrix. Then, we consider linear combinations of the powers of the root vector. Eventually, we find the particular combination that represents Fibonacci vectors. We show that in the case of two-dimensional vectors, this representation of the components of the vectors is identical to Binet‚Äôs formula for calculating Fibonacci numbers. We also illustrate the use of the Fibonacci vector calculation formula in the case of three-dimensional vectors.},

For the one-dimensional case, we derive analytically the optimal size of the vector of control variates under specific assumptions on the covariance matrix. For the multidimensional case, our numerical results show that good variance reduction is achieved when the number of control variates is relatively small (approximately of the same order as the number of unknown parameters). Finally, we give some recommendations for future research.},

The target population's elements are divided into distinct groups or strata where within each stratum the elements are similar to each other with respect to select characteristics of importance to the survey. Stratification is also used to increase the efficiency of a sample design with respect to survey costs and estimator precision. In this article, the foundations of stratified sampling are discussed in the framework of simple random sampling. Topics include the forming of the strata and optimal sample allocation among the strata. Practical implementation issues for stratified sampling are discussed and include systematic sampling, implicit stratification, and the construction of strata using modern software. The importance of using stratified sampling in practice is demonstrated by its usage in five major large-scale health surveys conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom. For these surveys, details of the stratification and sampling methods are provided. Topics include multistage cluster sampling within strata and the use of systematic and probability proportional to size sampling.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo is one of the most versatile and widely used numerical methods. Its convergence rate, O(N‚àí1/2), is independent of dimension, which shows Monte Carlo to be very robust but also slow. This article presents an introduction to Monte Carlo methods for integration problems, including convergence theory, sampling methods and variance reduction techniques. Accelerated convergence for Monte Carlo quadrature is attained using quasi-random (also called low-discrepancy) sequences, which are a deterministic alternative to random or pseudo-random sequences. The points in a quasi-random sequence are correlated to provide greater uniformity. The resulting quadrature method, called quasi-Monte Carlo, has a convergence rate of approximately O((logN)kN‚àí1). For quasi-Monte Carlo, both theoretical error estimates and practical limitations are presented. Although the emphasis in this article is on integration, Monte Carlo simulation of rarefied gas dynamics is also discussed. In the limit of small mean free path (that is, the fluid dynamic limit), Monte Carlo loses its effectiveness because the collisional distance is much less than the fluid dynamic length scale. Computational examples are presented throughout the text to illustrate the theory. A number of open problems are described.},
